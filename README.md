## Objective of the Project

Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) are among the most common and preventable healthcare-associated infections in California hospitals. This report combines robust data analytics from both Power BI and Python-based machine learning to present a comprehensive dashboard and strategic framework for reducing SSIs. Our analysis covered over 18,000 records from 2021 to 2023, uncovering patterns in infection rates by procedure type, geographic region, and facility.

The core objective is to inform and propose data-driven policy recommendations aimed at reducing surgical site infections (SSIs) and enhancing patient safety. This analysis will leverage comprehensive historical data on adult SSIs from California hospitals (2021–2023) to examine infection trends, identify high-risk areas, and uncover contributing factors. The aim is to create a data-driven framework that visualizes these trends and provides actionable insights for hospital administrators to improve patient outcomes and develop effective SSI prevention strategies.

Our findings reveal that infections are concentrated in specific procedures (e.g., Colon Surgery), facilities, and counties such as Los Angeles and Yuba. Using predictive analytics, we developed machine learning models with up to 69% accuracy in identifying high-risk procedures and facilities. Unsupervised learning further segmented hospitals into four distinct risk personas.

The report concludes with a 10-point policy framework designed to help administrators implement targeted interventions, allocate resources efficiently, and build real-time AI-powered surveillance systems.


## Problem Being Addressed

Surgical site infections pose a critical challenge in healthcare, leading to increased morbidity, mortality, prolonged hospital stays, and elevated healthcare costs. With the rising number of surgical procedures and the growing threat of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, managing and preventing SSIs has become more urgent. Despite advancements in medical practices, California hospitals continue to face difficulties in controlling SSIs. This analysis addresses the need to understand infection patterns and the factors influencing their occurrence to guide policy and resource allocation for prevention efforts.



## Key Findings

1. **Overall SIR Improved but Remains a Mixed Performance Across Facilities**  
   In 2023, the average Standardized Infection Ratio (SIR) decreased by 4.3% from 0.84 in 2022 to 0.80. While this indicates a general improvement in infection control, over 1,100 facilities still performed worse than expected, highlighting a widespread need for quality improvement in infection prevention practices.

2. **Increased Infections and Procedures Signal Growing Exposure Risk**  
   Despite a reduction in SIR, total procedures increased by 0.8% and reported infections rose by 0.8%, indicating a higher volume of patients exposed to infection risks. This suggests that while infection control might be improving relatively, the healthcare system is under greater pressure due to rising patient volumes.

3. **Significant Variation in Facility Performance**  
   Facilities like George L. Mee Hospital and Children Hospital of Orange County recorded very high SIRs (6.67 and 7.69 respectively), though with low infection counts. This discrepancy suggests that even facilities with a small number of infections can drastically deviate from expected standards if their predicted infection count is low.

4. **Counties Like Yuba and Inyo Show Alarming Trends**  
   Yuba’s SIR increased by 496.2%, and Inyo’s by 452.3%, indicating sharp deterioration in infection performance at a county level, despite a decrease in actual infections in Yuba. This reveals how SIR can escalate dramatically when predicted values drop more quickly than reported cases.

5. **Procedure Types Show High-Risk Categories**  
   Certain procedures like Heart Transplants (SIR = 4.92) and Pacemaker surgeries (SIR = 1.48) consistently show higher-than-expected infection ratios, suggesting these should be prioritized for targeted safety interventions.

6. **Pediatric and Major Teaching Facilities Tend to Have Higher SIRs**  
   Facility type analysis shows that Pediatric (2.09) and Major Teaching Hospitals (0.87) tend to have higher SIRs compared to Critical Access facilities (0.78), possibly due to case complexity or procedural intensity.


## Actionable Insights (Policy-Oriented Recommendations)

1. **Implement Targeted Infection Control Protocols for High-Risk Procedures**  
   **Policy:** All hospitals performing heart transplants, pacemaker implantations, and colon surgeries must adhere to enhanced infection prevention protocols, including mandatory pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis checks, stricter sterilization audits, and extended post-op monitoring for surgical site infections (SSI).  
   **Rationale:** These procedures consistently show high SIRs (e.g., heart transplants with SIR of 4.92 and colon surgeries with the highest reported infections), identifying them as key contributors to healthcare-associated infections (HAIs).

2. **Mandate Annual External Infection Control Audits in Underperforming Facilities**  
   **Policy:** Facilities with SIRs greater than 2.0 or that performed worse than the national benchmark for two consecutive years must undergo external infection control audits and submit quarterly corrective action plans.  
   **Rationale:** Over 1,100 facilities underperformed compared to benchmarks in 2023, indicating systemic gaps that internal reporting alone may not resolve.

3. **Scale Infection Prevention Resources Based on County-Level Performance**  
   **Policy:** Allocate additional state or federal infection prevention funding, training, and oversight to counties with >100% YoY SIR increases (e.g., Yuba and Inyo).  
   **Rationale:** These counties experienced alarming spikes (Yuba +496%, Inyo +452%), signaling either capacity overload, resource misallocation, or outdated infection control practices.

4. **Stratify Infection Monitoring by Facility Type and Complexity**  
   **Policy:** Redesign benchmarking to account for patient mix and procedural complexity, especially for pediatric and major teaching hospitals which consistently report higher SIRs.  
   **Rationale:** Teaching and pediatric hospitals often manage more complex or immunocompromised cases, inflating SIR metrics. Adjusted risk models can improve fairness and intervention targeting.

5. **Introduce Real-Time SIR Dashboards in Power BI for All Facilities**  
   **Policy:** Require all reporting hospitals to maintain a Power BI-based live dashboard tracking monthly SIR, infection counts, and procedure volumes, accessible by health departments and oversight boards.  
   **Rationale:** Improved visibility enables quicker responses and supports data-driven decisions across multiple levels of care delivery.

6. **Deploy AI-Powered Early Warning Systems in All Reporting Hospitals**  
   **Policy:** Require hospitals to implement AI-driven infection surveillance systems using real-time data from electronic health records (EHRs) to predict HAIs before clinical onset.  
   **Rationale:** Advanced machine learning models (e.g., neural networks, random forests) can analyze patient vitals, lab results, and historical patterns to detect subtle early signals of infections. Predictive accuracy has been shown to exceed 85% in clinical trials, enabling proactive interventions.

7. **Establish a National Neural Network Registry for Infection Surveillance**  
   **Policy:** Mandate the creation of a centralized, privacy-compliant neural-link registry, where anonymized clinical and procedural data from facilities are fed into a national deep learning model that continuously learns from new infections and adjusts risk benchmarks dynamically.  
   **Rationale:** Such a model enables intelligent benchmarking, accounting for seasonal trends, regional pathogen profiles, and facility-specific characteristics. The neural link ensures adaptive learning and evolves with new strains and treatment protocols.

8. **Incentivize Private-Sector AI Partnerships for Infection Control Innovation**  
   **Policy:** Provide grants and data access privileges to vetted AI startups and research labs to co-develop custom infection prediction or anomaly detection models tailored to specific hospital types (e.g., pediatrics, trauma, oncology).  
   **Rationale:** Leveraging external expertise accelerates model development and infuses innovation. Models trained with hospital-specific data can outperform general ones, improving outcomes and efficiency.

9. **Deploy Federated Learning Frameworks for Privacy-First AI Training**  
   **Policy:** To preserve patient privacy, hospitals must participate in federated learning systems that train AI models locally and share only encrypted model updates to the central neural network.  
   **Rationale:** Federated AI enables robust model development across diverse datasets without compromising patient confidentiality—a critical concern in health data governance.
